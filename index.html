                                This project was started as part of an assignment to create a game in java viewable
                                exclusively
                                by printing to a console. This constraint was given to reduce our focus on visual
                                elements
                                and
                                prioritize the components that the game would be based upon. With this constraint in
                                mind, I
                                wanted to create a game with some level of story and visual allure while still being
                                functional.
                            </p>
                            <p class="A_Description BTCDesc" id="BTCDesc2" style="display: none;">
                                The three primary aspects of the game including managing energy, gathering and using
                                items,
                                and surviving events (with the primary three events being implementations of pacman,
                                hangman
                                or
                                wordle, and pictionary). Events occur at random when the player continues the game, and
                                certain
                                items discovered (primarily through pacman) would assist the user with future events.

                                Energy was implemented to further exacerbate the impact of randomness. As the game
                                progresses,
                                the difficulty of each event increases, and energy must be managed to prevent the player
                                from
                                being impaired in future events.

                                The games initial design was constructed in a way that made it difficult to implement
                                new
                                events and items in the future. Upon learning object-oriented programming concepts such
                                as
                                inheritance and abstract classes, I was able to reimplement encounters in a manner that
                                was
                                not only easier to read, but also easier to edit in the event of future additions.

                                This was a personal project I decided to make due to difficulties with online reminders.
                                When looking for a means of providing reminders to myself without using a phone, the
                                internet,
                                or a roundabout method on my calendar, I struggled to find anythinsg simple or
                                straightforward.
                                Thus, it is with this in mind that I decided to create a simple notification manager.
                            </p>
                            <p class="A_Description NMMDesc" id="NMMDesc2" style="display: none;">
                                Designing this was a unique test for not only saving and reading information but also
                                working
                                with one's current device constraints in mind. Unlike past projects which had
                                'self-imposed'
                                constraints (such as with games), the constraints of notifications were more bound by
                                reality.
                                This included not allowing notifications to be made for dates that have already passed,
                                making
                                notifications readable not only on the actual notifications but also to the formatted
                                file
                                they
                                they were saved to, and allowing notifications to be edited and reread by the manager
                                without
                            </p>
                            <p class="A_Description NMMDesc" id="NMMDesc3" style="display: none;">
                                The biggest challenge of this project was allowing it to save and re-read Notifications.
                                I
                                decided early on that I wanted to save to a txt file since it would allow for users to
                                read
                                and
                                directly
                                edit the notifications they created if they wanted to change something after making a
                                notification. However, in doing so, I encountered multiple issues, specifically with
                                rereading
                                manually
                                inputted notifications or clearing old ones that have already occured. To resolve this,
                                I
                                incorporated a
                                strict forma for how notifications should be written to the txt file, with those
                                neglecting
                                this
                                format being completely ignored.

                                This poster was the result of a typography project aimed to make news of guest speakers
                                both
                                readable
                                and appealing to the average passerby. Given that the target audience would be
                                university
                                students
                                walking to their lectures, club activities, or dorms, posters had to be designed with
                                the
                                intention
                                of grabbing attention and keeping it long enough for those passing to skim the
                                information
                                on
                                the poster.
                                The left and right sides are the first and last main iterations of the poster
                                respectively.
