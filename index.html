                        This project was started as part of an assignment to create a game in java viewable exclusively
                        by printing to a console. This constraint was given to reduce our focus on visual elements and
                        prioritize the components that the game would be based upon. With this constraint in mind, I
                        wanted to create a game with some level of story and visual allure while still being functional.
                    </p>
                    <p class="A_Description BTCDesc" id="BTCDesc2" style="display: none;">
                        The three primary aspects of the game including managing energy, gathering and using items,
                        and surviving events (with the primary three events being implementations of pacman, hangman or
                        wordle, and pictionary). Events occur at random when the player continues the game, and certain
                        items discovered (primarily through pacman) would assist the user with future events.

                        Energy was implemented to further exacerbate the impact of randomness. As the game progresses,
                        the difficulty of each event increases, and energy must be managed to prevent the player from
                        being impaired in future events.

                        The games initial design was constructed in a way that made it difficult to implement new
                        events and items in the future. Upon learning object-oriented programming concepts such as
                        inheritance and abstract classes, I was able to reimplement encounters in a manner that was
                        not only easier to read, but also easier to edit in the event of future additions.

                        This was a personal project I decided to make due to difficulties with online reminders.
                        When looking for a means of providing reminders to myself without using a phone, the internet,
                        or a roundabout method on my calendar, I struggled to find anythinsg simple or straightforward.
                        Thus, it is with this in mind that I decided to create a simple notification manager.
                    </p>
                    <p class="A_Description NMMDesc" id="NMMDesc2" style="display: none;">
                        Designing this was a unique test for not only saving and reading information but also working
                        with one's current device constraints in mind. Unlike past projects which had 'self-imposed'
                        constraints (such as with games), the constraints of notifications were more bound by reality.
                        This included not allowing notifications to be made for dates that have already passed, making
                        notifications readable not only on the actual notifications but also to the formatted file they
                        they were saved to, and allowing notifications to be edited and reread by the manager without
                    </p>
                    <p class="A_Description NMMDesc" id="NMMDesc3" style="display: none;">
                        The biggest challenge of this project was allowing it to save and re-read Notifications. I
                        decided early on that I wanted to save to a txt file since it would allow for users to read and
                        directly
                        edit the notifications they created if they wanted to change something after making a
                        notification. However, in doing so, I encountered multiple issues, specifically with rereading
                        manually
                        inputted notifications or clearing old ones that have already occured. To resolve this, I
                        incorporated a
                        strict forma for how notifications should be written to the txt file, with those neglecting this
                        format being completely ignored.

                        This project was a joint effort with two collaborators to encapsulate the experience design
                        process.
                        In addition to mapping out a user's journey throughout our mock product, a mental health
                        'wellness hub'
                        in the form of a website, physical stations, and pamphlets, we also practiced methods including,
                        but not
                        limited to, journey maps, data acquisition, and prototyping.

                    This poster was the result of a typography project aimed to make news of guest speakers both
                    readable
                    and appealing to the average passerby. Given that the target audience would be university
                    students
                    walking to their lectures, club activities, or dorms, posters had to be designed with the
                    intention
                    of grabbing attention and keeping it long enough for those passing to skim the information on
                    the poster.
                    The left and right sides are the first and last main iterations of the poster respectively.
